In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to them, and they do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable.\n",

When you try to access a variable that has been deleted using the del statement, it will raise a NameError. This is because the variable no longer exists in memory, and Python cannot find it when you try to access it. To avoid this error, you should ensure that you do not try to access a variable after it has been deleted using the del statement. If you need to use the variable again, you will need to reassign it a value before accessing it."
