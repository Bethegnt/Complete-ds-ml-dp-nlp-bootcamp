The type of a variable is inferred based on the value assigned to it. For example, if you assign an integer value to a variable, Python will infer that the variable is of type int. If you assign a string value to a variable, Python will infer that the variable is of type str. This allows for greater flexibility in coding, as you can easily change the type of a variable by assigning it a different value. However, it also means that you need to be careful when working with variables, as the type of a variable can change unexpectedly if you assign it a new value of a different type.\n",
